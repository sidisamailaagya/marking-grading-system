📖 Overview

The Hybrid Marking & Grading System is a web-based application designed to improve fairness, consistency, and efficiency in educational assessments. The system combines automation (for objective tasks like multiple-choice and short-answer questions) with human evaluation (for subjective tasks like essays, projects, and remarks).

It provides dashboards for Admins, Lecturers, and Students, making the grading process transparent, reducing errors, and enhancing student feedback and motivation.
